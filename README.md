🏥 HealthMitra — Production AI-Powered Rural Healthcare Platform
FastAPI React MongoDB Groq Docker AWS TailwindCSS

An Enterprise-Grade AI-Powered Healthcare Platform designed specifically for rural India. Built with FastAPI, React 19, MongoDB Atlas, Groq Llama 3.3 70B & Llama 3.2 Vision, Nginx, and Docker.

Featuring AI-Powered Symptom Triage, Multilingual NLP (English, Hindi, Gujarati, Tamil, Marathi), GPS Geospatial Hospital Discovery (Haversine & 2dsphere), Vision Medical Report Analyzer, ASHA Community Worker Dashboard, Bcrypt/JWT Security, and Full Microservice Containerization.

## 🏗️ System Architecture & End-to-End Data Flow

The platform implements an asynchronous, microservice architecture spanning from hands-free voice and text input down to Groq Vision document analysis and geospatial hospital retrieval.

🔥 Key Technical Highlights & Features
1. 🩺 AI-Powered Symptom Triage & Multilingual NLP
Rule-Based & LLM Fallback Engine: Classifies symptoms into 3 urgency tiers (Self-Care, Visit Clinic, Emergency) across 60+ deterministic medical rules and Groq/Llama reasoning.
Multilingual Support: Supports 5 Indian languages (English, Hindi, Gujarati, Tamil, Marathi) using Groq Llama 3.3 70B for zero-shot medical translation and context retention.
Voice Input Integration: Web Speech API implementation enabling hands-free voice symptom entry for low-literacy users.
2. 📄 Medical Report & Lab Analyzer (Groq Llama 3.2 Vision)
Multi-Modal Document Parsing: Upload PDF or image lab reports (CBC, Lipid Panel, Radiology).
Vision Extraction Pipeline: Powered by Groq Llama 3.2 Vision to extract medical entities, abnormal values, and plain-language patient explanations.
3. 🏨 Geospatial Hospital Discovery Engine
GPS Location Detection: Browser Geolocation API with IP-based fallback mechanisms.
Haversine Distance & 2dsphere Indexing: Computes exact distance in kilometers to 20+ pre-seeded regional hospitals and health centers across India.
Interactive Leaflet Canvas: Visual map interface with distance sorting, emergency contact triggers, and navigation directions.
4. 👩‍⚕️ ASHA Community Worker Dashboard
Village Healthcare Management: Specialized portal for Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHA) to monitor community health trends.
Patient History & Analytics: Role-based aggregated metrics, emergency alerts, and triage record management.
5. 🛡️ Role-Based Security & Auth Engine
JWT Authorization: Cryptographically signed JSON Web Tokens (python-jose) enforcing Patient and ASHA_Worker role permissions.
Bcrypt Password Security: Direct salted password hashing protecting user data privacy.
6. 💊 OTC Medicine Information & Safety Engine
